<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A veritable Wandering Jew is he; for still the foolish girls listen, so they say, to the dying away of his hoof-beats.</p><p>In this land of many ruins, that long while ago were voice-filled homes, linger many legends; and here again, giving you the essentials, I leave you to cook the dish for yourself. Take a human heart or two, assorted; a bundle of human passions--there are not many of them, half a dozen at the most; season with a mixture of good and evil; flavour the whole with the sauce of death, and serve up where and when you will. "The Saint's Cell," "The Haunted Keep," "The Dungeon Grave," "The Lover's Leap"--call it what you will, the stew's the same.</p></div> </div>
