<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This was built but yesterday, while that was fashioned ages ago, some say even before the swallows came; who knows?</p><p>Nor will there be found herein folk-lore or story.</p><p>Every valley where lie homesteads has its song. I will tell you the plot; you can turn it into verse and set it to music of your own.</p><p>There lived a lass, and there came a lad, who loved and rode away.</p><p>It is a monotonous song, written in many languages; for the young man seems to have been a mighty traveller. Here in sentimental Germany they remember him well. So also the dwellers of the Blue Alsatian Mountains remember his coming among them; while, if my memory serves me truly, he likewise visited the Banks of Allan Water.</p></div> </div>
