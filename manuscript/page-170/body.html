<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I wish to be equally frank with the reader of this book. I wish here conscientiously to let forth its shortcomings. I wish no one to read this book under a misapprehension.</p><p>There will be no useful information in this book.</p><p>Anyone who should think that with the aid of this book he would be able to make a tour through Germany and the Black Forest would probably lose himself before he got to the Nore. That, at all events, would be the best thing that could happen to him. The farther away from home he got, the greater only would be his difficulties.</p><p>I do not regard the conveyance of useful information as my forte. This belief was not inborn with me; it has been driven home upon me by experience.</p></div> </div>
