How lose one's self in historical reverie amid the odour of roast veal and spinach?</p><p>One day, on elevating thoughts intent, we climbed through tangled woods.</p><p>"And at the top," said Harris, bitterly, as we paused to breathe a space and pull our belts a hole tighter, "there will be a gaudy restaurant, where people will be guzzling beefsteaks and plum tarts and drinking white wine."</p><p>"Do you think so?" said George.</p><p>"Sure to be," answered Harris; "you know their way. Not one grove will they consent to dedicate to solitude and contemplation; not one height will they leave to the lover of nature unpolluted by the gross and the material."</p></div> </div>
