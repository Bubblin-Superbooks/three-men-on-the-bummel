<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus Sin masquerades under the guise of Good, and one sleeps till six, explaining to one's conscience, who, however, doesn't believe it, that one does this because of unselfish consideration for others. I have known such consideration extend until seven of the clock.</p><p>Likewise, distance measured with a pair of compasses is not precisely the same as when measured by the leg.</p><p>"Ten miles an hour for seven hours, seventy miles. A nice easy day's work."</p><p>"There are some stiff hills to climb?"</p><p>"The other side to come down. Say, eight miles an hour, and call it sixty miles. Gott in Himmel! if we can't average eight miles an hour, we had better go in bath-chairs." It does seem somewhat impossible to do less, on paper.</p></div> </div>
