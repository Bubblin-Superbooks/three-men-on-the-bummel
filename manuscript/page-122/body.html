<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Pa, may I get up?"</p><p>You do not hear the other voice, but the responses are:</p><p>"No, it was only the bath--no, she ain't really hurt,--only wet, you know. Yes, ma, I'll tell 'em what you say. No, it was a pure accident. Yes; good-night, papa."</p><p>Then the same voice, exerting itself so as to be heard in a distant part of the house, remarks:</p><p>"You've got to come upstairs again. Pa says it isn't time yet to get up."</p><p>You return to bed, and lie listening to somebody being dragged upstairs, evidently against their will. By a thoughtful arrangement the spare rooms at "Beggarbush" are exactly underneath the nurseries. The same somebody, you conclude, still offering the most creditable opposition, is being put back into bed.</p></div> </div>
