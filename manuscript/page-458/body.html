Each country keeps a special pronunciation exclusively for the use of foreigners--a pronunciation they never dream of using themselves, that they cannot understand when it is used. I once heard an English lady explaining to a Frenchman how to pronounce the word Have.</p><p>"You will pronounce it," said the lady reproachfully, "as if it were spelt H-a-v. It isn't. There is an 'e' at the end."</p><p>"But I thought," said the pupil, "that you did not sound the 'e' at the end of h-a-v-e."</p><p>"No more you do," explained his teacher. "It is what we call a mute 'e'; but it exercises a modifying influence on the preceding vowel."</p></div> </div>
