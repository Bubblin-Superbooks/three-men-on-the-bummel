<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> All three routes, so the porter explained to us, were complicated, necessitating changing and re- changing. There was not much time for calm elucidation, as our own train was starting in a few minutes. The man himself was voluble--always a mistake when anything entangled has to be made clear; while the porter was only too eager to get the job done with and so breathe again. It dawned upon me ten minutes later, when thinking the matter over in the train, that though I had agreed with the porter that it would be best for the bicycle to go by way of Immendingen, and had agreed to his booking it to Immendingen, I had neglected to give instructions for its departure from Immendingen. Were I of a despondent temperament I should be worrying myself at the present moment with the reflection that in all probability that bicycle is still at Immendingen to this day.</p></div> </div>
