<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A policeman was standing there. He had all the things I had been throwing out of the window in a little heap in front of him, all except the egg. He had evidently been collecting them. He said:</p><p>"Are these things yours?"</p><p>I said: "They were mine, but personally I have done with them. Anybody can have them--you can have them."</p><p>He ignored my offer. He said:</p><p>"You threw these things out of window."</p><p>"You are right," I admitted; "I did."</p><p>"Why did you throw them out of window?" he asked. A German policeman has his code of questions arranged for him; he never varies them, and he never omits one.</p></div> </div>
